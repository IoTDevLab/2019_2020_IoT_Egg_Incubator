# IoT Automatic Egg Incubator

 The IoT Automatic Egg Incubator is similar to the type of incubator which can be used as a substitute of poultry chicken to incubate the chicken eggs automatically. It will be helpful for the farmers to incubate their eggs automatically without the need of human intervention, by keeping the physical quantities such as temperature and humidity at required level, so that the fetuses inside them will grow and incubates without the presence of the mother.
